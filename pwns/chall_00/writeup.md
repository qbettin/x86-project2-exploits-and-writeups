Starting this was very hard, I hope I will not let myself get this far behind again and am writing it out just to make it more likely.
I started by looking at the chall_00 writeup for the 18 speedrun problems
My main issue was getting the correct # for the offest or junk bytes
I leanred we can subtract the hex values of the registers to figure this out
the char was at 0x110 and the overwrite_me was a 0x4
- i did 0x110 - 0x4 to get 0x10c
- then added the 0x69420 to the payload
With this knowledge the rest was simple, I send the line and did p.interactive() like in the writeup which opened a new shell

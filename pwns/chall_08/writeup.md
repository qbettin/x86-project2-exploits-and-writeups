- honestly still lost on this, will update when I understand
- I just followed the exploit from sunshine ctf speedrun_08
- but realized the order of %d and %ld was changed, and that the first var_10h was what was being passed into the puts (maybe?)
- so i reversed those lines, and got the shell so 

UPDATE (did this right after)
- The main confusion i had was with the order or the %d and %ld calls, which was opposite of that in the sunshine problem
- however this is just a compiler thing, so reversing the order is necessary, but is not reflective of how the bytes are stored
    - i thought it put our address in memory and then the junk, which didnt make sense in my mind because how would it overwrite anything?
    - however behind the scenes this is not how it works
- It still 
    - Puts the correct offset of junk to get to the location of the GOT of gets()
    - Overwrites the value with the win address
    - and when gets() is called, it calls the win address and opens a shell

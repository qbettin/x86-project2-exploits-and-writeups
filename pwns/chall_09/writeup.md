- var_54h / rbp-0x54 = local_5c
- var_50h is the buffer for the fgets = local_58h
    - allows for 0x32 or 50 bytes
- however none of this really matters
- im assuming the program looks something like this
if ((var_50h[var_54h] ^ 0x69) != key[var_54h]) {
        exit(0);
      }
    var54h = var54h + 1;
    system("/bin/sh");
- so we just need to send the key xored with 0x69

- this didnt originally work, however I realized I need to send a nullbyte character aswell

- staticlaly linked so solution from chall13 cant work
- also 64 bit
- a ret is really just a pop rip
- need to hijack the instruction pointer
- can get a seg fault (this is good)

- in essence we need to send the amount of junk which is the offset of our buffer from the bp + 8, then send our rop chain

- I was originally trying to manually find all the ROPgadges I needed by running
    - ROPgadget â€“binary split | less
    - but then realized 
        - ROPgadget --binary chall_14 --ropchain was better
- For this exploit, this wasnt needed though...
- We need to run 
    - ropper --file chall_14 --chain "execve cmd=/bin/sh" --badbytes 0a
    - this generates us a ROP chain that gets the execve command to call /bin/sh

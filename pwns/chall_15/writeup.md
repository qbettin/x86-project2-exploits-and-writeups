- Has PIE (address randomization)
- Has RWX segments and stack is exe
    - definitely need shellcode
- we just need to send a payload that... 
    - starts with our shellcode
    - followed by junk to get to var_8h
    - overwrite var_8h with correct hex val
    - overwirte var_4h with correct hex val
    - send the remaining bytes to get to base pointer
    - send an additional 8 because rule of ryan and 64 bit
    - send the leaked stack addr

- This will set the instruction pointer to our stack leak, which is where our payload lives
- Then when the program 'returns', our shell is created from the shellcode in the beginning of our payload
- And it wont exit before hand because var4 and var8 are the correct hex values

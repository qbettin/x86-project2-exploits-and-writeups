- NX enabled so we can overwirte
- we need to overwtie puts in the GOT to call vuln multiple times to leak addrs

- buffer is bigger than what vuln reads so no BOF

- we need to exploit the printf without a format string


- when i do a bunch of %p's
  - 0x40 0xf7f03580 0x8049255 0xf7f03d20 0x1c 0xffc22578 0x25207025 0x70252070 0x20702520 0x25207025 0x70252070 0x20702520 0x25207025 0x70252070 0x20702520 0x25207025 0x70252070 0x20702520 0x25207025 0x70252070 0x20702520 poop

  -0x8049255 is the vulnerable one i think but we really dont do anything with it in the exploit so idk

  - need to replace puts GOT with win address
  - the offset was 7 for some reason i still dont understand

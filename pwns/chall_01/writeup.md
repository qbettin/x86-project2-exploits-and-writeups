First had to fully understand the rbp and how that worked
I got to a point where my payload was looking like -> b'A' * (0x110 - 0x8) + p32(0x1337) + b'A' * (0x2) + p32(0x69696969)
However this is wrong becuase although 0x1337 is 2 bytes, p32 fills the rest of the missing bytes with 0's. I was trying to add those aswell, which was 
actually writing into the first half of the overwrite_me var, with the second half being 6969. 
Thankfully our discord saved me on this one! I tried way too many other things but it was a simple as it automatically fills the empty space.

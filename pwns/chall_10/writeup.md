- NX enabled so we can overwirte
- also 32 bit so we can jump to win easily

- param1 = arg8h = rbp + 8 which is the buffer gets passes to win from vuln
- i dont think iVar1 is doing anything in this as it just just being moved into ebx at the end
- in vuln our buffer is at rbp -0x308
  - need to send this amounf junk
  - then the win addr
  - then overwirte the var in win with 0x1a55fac3 (basically send 4 more bytes bc of 32 bit and this is where first argument lives)

- this will
  - allow us to jump into win
  - overwrite the variable in win to pass the check
  - and call binsh
